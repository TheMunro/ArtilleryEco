//In general, you will not need to use this class directly.
//For some requests, or if you are building a Harvester Ticklite (see: https://github.com/JKurzer/sd/blob/main/README.md )
//It may be necessary. It is slower, bulkier, less immediate, and more annoying than the processes you are accustomed to,
//but for certain things that touch the game thread, it may be the best option. New stuff like that should get added here.
//it is also made available to autoguns as a way of shimming out some pretty nasty concurrency problems.

constexpr int ALLOWED_THREADS_FOR_ARTILLERY = 64;

//these functions all create and enqueue a thing request and can be called from any thread that has called Feed().
//When F_INeedA is set up, these requests will go into the Threaded Accumulator (the BusyWorkerAcc machinery)...
//Then some thread will process the requests, likely the busy worker, doing the actual resolution.
//this is why the GrantedWith results have conditions that can be specified to let you know when or if the skeleton key is usable.
//Until the key is usable, it should not be separated from the GrantedWith structure or copied.
//I haven't spent a lot of time thinking about if the skeletonkey should get set later or if we should allocate a skeletonkey
//THEN try to build everything it represents, in this model.
//That would require an indirection mapping, which I find highly highly distasteful, but on the other hand, we're in
//extremely deep waters. On the grasping hand, everything we do to improve the UX NOW is a hundred bugs a year we don't have
//to _______________ ________ until ____ __ _________ and fix later.
// Find in files for YAGAMETHREADBOYRUNNETHREQUESTSHERE will show you the code in artillery dispatch that processes gamethread
// and YABUSYTHREADBOYRUNNETHREQUESTSHERE will show you the equivalent code in our mutual friend artillery busy worker.
