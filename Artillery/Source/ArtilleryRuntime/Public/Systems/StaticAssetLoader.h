/** We'll be using this UE method. It talks about objects, but that's not UObjects, it's just... objects.
 * What's a little inobvious is that you can hand in ustruct or a parent class.

 ** Find an optional object.
 * @see StaticFindObject()

  template< class T >
  inline T* FindObject(FTopLevelAssetPath InPath, bool ExactClass = false)

	return (T*)StaticFindObject(T::StaticClass(), InPath, ExactClass);
  }
 *
 * Other options include TStructOnScope, which is kinda a miss, since we're already getting lifecycle management from tsp
 * unless it has features that I missed in my cursory read over, or the much more interestin' FInstancedStruct. Now that's part of
 * a plugin called StructUtils, but I think that's either moved to core or we've had it on. Not sure. Anyway, if this doesn't work,
 * we have some good options.
 * anyway, today's special ingredient is datatables.
 *Allez cuisine!
